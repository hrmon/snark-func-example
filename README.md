This an blueprint example for FunC verifiers generated by https://github.com/hrmon/snarkjs-func.

To use this for your own instance,

* follow the guide on https://github.com/hrmon/snarkjs-func and generate the FunC verifier and call-data JS snippet for one of **Groth16** or **PLONK** protocols.
* Update contents of `contracts/groth16_verifier.fc` (or `contracts/plonk_verifier.fc`) and `tests/groth16_func_call.js` (or `tests/plonk_func_call.js`) with the generated verifier and snippet respectively.
* Run tests `npx blueprint test` to check.
